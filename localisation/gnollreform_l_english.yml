Although the adoptation of gnollish tactics and troops has been a boon to our nation, letting us win many wars not possible without their help, our neighbors are beginning to leave us behind. It is time to reform and modernize."
 
 flavor_gawed.war.title: "The Surrender of Viswall!"
 flavor_gawed.war.desc: "In exchange for accepting the treaty of Pearview in 1444 the City Palatine of Viswall was promised to the Kingdom of Lorent. In practice, however, this has still not come to pass. The Gawedi have repeatedly evaded the question and it is becoming increasingly clear that many in the Gawedi camp are arguing that the treaty will not be honored. In one last attempt to force the question, the King of Lorent has approached the City Palatine himself and demanded the surrender of the city.
The local Gawedi commander, however, shows no signs of intending to open the gates, despite not having a force strong enough to withstand an attack. Once more, the drums of war beat in the Small Country."
